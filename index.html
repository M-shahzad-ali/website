          <figcaption>Muhammad Ali Jinnah (born Mahomedali 
              Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September
               1948) was a barrister, politician and the f
               ounder of Pakistan.[2] Jinnah served as the
                leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until Pakistan's creation on 14 August 1947, and then as Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death. He is revered in Pakistan as Quaid-i-Azam ("Great Leader") and Baba-i-Qaum, ("Father of the Nation"). His birthday is considered a national holiday in Pakistan.[3][4]

            Born at Wazir Mansion in 
            Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at
             Lincoln's Inn in London. Upon his return to
              British India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of
             satyagraha, which he regarded as political 
             anarchy.</figcaption>

    <figcaption> <i>Sir Allama Muhammad Iqbal 
        (/ˈɪkbɑːl/; Urdu: محمد اِقبال‎; 9 November
         1877 – 21 April 1938), known as Allama Iq
         bal, was a poet, philosopher, theorist, and barrister
          in Pakistan. He has been called the "Spiritual Father
           of Pakistan" for his contributions to the nation. 
           Iqbal's poems, political contributions, and academic
            and scholarly research were distinguished.[1][2] He
             inspired the Pakistan movement in British India[3][4]
              and is considered a renowned figure of Urdu literature
              
              ,[5] although he wrote in both Urdu and Persian.[2][5]

        Iqbal is admired as a prominent poet
